#Basic rules of the game.
#The player starts with a given number of points. (POINTS)
#The player chooses between three levels.
#After this a text with blanks is diplayed according to the level chosen.
#The game is played by looping through the blanks until either all blanks are filled or the player has no more points left:
#   The player gets prompted with a blank to be filled in and has to guess on the answer.
#   If the players player gets the answer right the game is continued with the next blank.
#   If the player gets the answer wrong he looses one try and one point. After a given number of TRIES the game
#   continues with the next blank.
#Finally the players gets informed about his result and the full text with all the blanks filled in is displayed.





#These are global variables
POINTS=10 #number of points available to the player at the beginning, decreases
          #by one whenever the player makes a mistake
TRIES=3   #number of tries the player has per question
MAX_BLANKS=5 #Maximum number of blanks in one level
index=1
ENUM_LIST=[]    #serves as a helper variable to avoid typing
while index<=MAX_BLANKS:
    ENUM_LIST.append(' __'+str(index)+'__ ')
    index+=1
